/*Thanks to w3schools for this block of code here. I am currently debugging it;
the code itself is fine, it just isn't currently compatible with the navbar,
the basic design of which is also from w3schools.*/
/*So from here down to the next comment is currently broken; I will be
continuing to work my hardest to fix this bug. I believe it has to do with the
ordering of the elements of the page in index.html, however I couldn't say. I
do desire this dropdown to be located after the navbar, though.*/
